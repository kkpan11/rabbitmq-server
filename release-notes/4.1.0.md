## RabbitMQ 4.1.0

RabbitMQ 4.1.0 is a new feature release.

See Compatibility Notes below to learn about **breaking or potentially breaking changes** in this release.


## Highlights

Some key improvements in this release are listed below.

### Quorum Queue Throughput and Parallelism Improvements

Quorum queue log reads are now offloaded to channels (sessions, connections).

In practical terms this means improved consumer throughput, lower interference of publishers
on queue delivery rate to consumers, and improved CPU core utilization by each quorum queue
(assuming there are enough cores available to the node).

### Initial Support for AMQP 1.0 Filter Expressions

Support for the `properties` and `application-properties` filters of [AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0 Working Draft 09](https://groups.oasis-open.org/higherlogic/ws/public/document?document_id=66227).

As described in the [AMQP 1.0 Filter Expressions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2024/12/13/amqp-filter-expressions) blog post,
this feature enables multiple concurrent clients each consuming only a subset of messages from a stream while maintaining message order.

### Feature Flags Quality of Life Improvements

Graduated (mandatory) [feature flags](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/feature-flags) several minors ago has proven that they could use some user experience improvements.
For example, certain required feature flags will now be enabled on node boot when all nodes in the cluster support them.

See core server changes below as well as the [GitHub project dedicated to feature flags improvements](https://github.com/orgs/rabbitmq/projects/4/views/1)
for the complete list of related changes.


## Breaking Changes and Compatibility Notes

### Initial AMQP 0-9-1 Maximum Frame Size

Before a client connection can negotiate a maximum frame size (`frame_max`), it must authenticate
successfully. Before the authenticated phase, a special lower `frame_max` value
is used.

With this release, the value was increased from the original 4096 bytes to 8192
to accommodate larger [JWT tokens](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/oauth2).

Clients that do override `frame_max` now must use values of 8192 bytes or greater.
We recommend using the default server value of `131072`: do not override the `frame_max`
key in `rabbitmq.conf` and do not set it in the application code.

[`amqplib`](https://github.com/amqp-node/amqplib/) is a popular client library that has been using
a low `frame_max` default of `4096`. Its users must [upgrade to a compatible version](https://github.com/amqp-node/amqplib/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0107)
(starting with `0.10.7`) or explicitly use a higher `frame_max`.


### MQTT

 * The default MQTT [Maximum Packet Size](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901086) changed from 256 MiB to 16 MiB.

   This default can be overridden by [configuring](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#config-file) `mqtt.max_packet_size_authenticated`.
   Note that this value must not be greater than `max_message_size` (which also defaults to 16 MiB).

### etcd Peer Discovery

The following `rabbitmq.conf` settings are unsupported:
* `cluster_formation.etcd.ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert`
* `cluster_formation.etcd.ssl_options.dh`
* `cluster_formation.etcd.ssl_options.dhfile`

## Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 26.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) and supports Erlang 27.x.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 26.x and 27.x.


## Release Artifacts

Artifacts for preview releases are distributed via GitHub releases:

 * In main repository, [`rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases)
 * In the development builds repository, [`rabbitmq/server-packages`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/server-packages/releases)

There is a `4.1.0` preview version of the [community RabbitMQ image](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq).


## Upgrading to 4.1.0

### Documentation guides on upgrades

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade) for documentation on upgrades and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases)
for release notes of individual releases.

This release series supports upgrades from `4.0.x` and `3.13.x`.

[Blue/Green Deployment](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/blue-green-upgrade)-style upgrades are avaialble for migrations
from RabbitMQ `3.12.x` series.

### New Required Feature Flags

None. The required feature flag set is the same as in `4.0.x`.

### Mixed version cluster compatibility

RabbitMQ 4.1.0 nodes can run alongside `4.0.x` nodes. `4.1.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster
upgrade to 4.0.0 or a later patch release in the new series.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes will be covered in future updates.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 4.1.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended
periods of time (no more than a few hours).

### Recommended Post-upgrade Procedures

This version does not require any additional post-upgrade procedures
compared to other versions.



## Changes Worth Mentioning

This section can be incomplete and will be expanded as 4.1 approaches its release candidate stage.

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * Quorum queue log reads are now offloaded to channels (sessions, connections).

   In practical terms this means improved consumer throughput, lower interference of publishers
   on queue delivery rate to consumers, and improved CPU core utilization by each quorum queue
   (assuming there are enough cores available to the node).

   GitHub issue: [#12713](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12713)

 * Feature flag quality of live improvements.

   Certain required feature flags will now be automatically required on node boot
   and do not have to be explicitly enabled before an upgrade.
   This does not apply to all feature flags, however.

   GitHub project: [#4](https://github.com/orgs/rabbitmq/projects/4/views/1).

   GitHub issues: [#12466](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12466), [#12444](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12444),
                  [#12447](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12447)

 * `properties` and `appliation-properties` filters of [AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0 Working Draft 09](https://groups.oasis-open.org/higherlogic/ws/public/document?document_id=66227)
    when consuming from a stream via AMQP 1.0. String prefix and suffix matching is also supported.

    This feature adds the ability to RabbitMQ to have multiple concurrent clients each consuming only a subset of messages while maintaining message order.
    It also reduces network traffic between RabbitMQ and clients by only dispatching those messages that the clients are actually interested in.

    GitHub issue: [#12415](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12415)

 * Larger (up to 8192 bytes) [JWT tokens](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/oauth2) now can be used by AMQP 0-9-1 clients.

   Before a client connection can negotiate a maximum frame size (`frame_max`), it must authenticate
   successfully. Before the authenticated phase, a special lower `frame_max` value
   is used.

   Clients that do override `frame_max` now must use values of 8192 bytes or greater.
   We recommend using the default server value of `131072`: do not override the `frame_max`
   key in `rabbitmq.conf` and do not set it in the application code.

   [`amqplib`](https://github.com/amqp-node/amqplib/) is a popular client library that has been using
   a low `frame_max` default of `4096`. Its users must [upgrade to a compatible version](https://github.com/amqp-node/amqplib/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0107)
   (starting with `0.10.7`) or explicitly use a higher `frame_max`.

   GitHub issue: [#13541](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13541)

 *  AMQP 1.0 connections that use OAuth 2.0 now can renew their JWT tokens
    This allows clients to set a new token proactively before the current one [expires](/docs/oauth2#token-expiration), ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.
    If a client does not set a new token before the existing one expires, RabbitMQ will automatically close the AMQP 1.0 connection.

    GitHub issue: [#12599](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12599)

 * AMQP 1.0 filters now have capped complexity: filtering on more than 16 properties
   won't be possible. This is a protection mechanism recommended in the AMQP 1.0 spec.

   GitHub issue: [#13196](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13196)

 * Support for Multiple Routing Keys in AMQP 1.0 via `x-cc` Message Annotation.

   AMQP 1.0 publishers now can set multiple routing keys by using the `x-cc` message annotation.
   This annotation allows publishers to specify a [list](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-list)
   of routing keys ([strings](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-string)) for more flexible message distribution,
   similar to the [CC](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/sender-selected) header in AMQP 0.9.1.

   GitHub issue: [#12559](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12559)

 * Support field `dynamic` of AMQP 1.0 [source](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-source) and [target](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-target).

   This allows AMQP clients to dynamically create [exclusive queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/queues#exclusive-queues), which can be useful for RPC workloads.

   GitHub issue: [#13231](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13231)

 * Quorum queue checkpoint algorithm was tweaked to take checkpoints more frequently, thus
   clearing older segment files more aggressively.

   Workloads that use larger messages should continue following [the documented recommendations](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues#performance-tuning-large-messages) to
   avoid large disk space footprint of segment files.

   GitHub issue: [#13622](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13622)

 * Previously a node that was a cluster member but then was [reset](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/clustering#restarting-with-hostname-changes) could not
   rejoin the cluster if the [schema data store](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/metadata-store) was Mnesia.

   Now the reset node will try to leave the cluster and retry rejoining again.
   This was already the case for Khepri.

   Contributed by @SimonUnge.

   GitHub issue: [#13643](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13643)

 * Nodes will now fall back to system CA certificate list (if available) when no CA certificate
   is explicitly configured.

   Contributed by @LoisSotoLopez.

   GitHub issue: [#10519](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10519), [#12564](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12564)

 * AMQP 1.0 and AMQP 0-9-1 connections now dynamically adjust their TCP socket buffers.

   GitHub issue: [#13363](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13363)

 * Peer discovery resilience improvements.

   GitHub issues: [#12801](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12801), [#12809](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12809)

 * Quorum queue's [continuous membership reconciliation mechanism](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues#replica-reconciliation) (CMR) efficiency
   and resilience improvements.

   GitHub issue: [#13703](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13703)

 * AMQP 1.0 and AMQP 0-9-1 connections now produce more specific error messages when an incorrect data is sent
   by the client during connection negotiation.

   For example, when a [TLS-enabled](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/ssl) client connects to a non-TLS port, or an HTTP GET request is sent to the AMQP port.

   GitHub issue: [#13559](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13559)

 * AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 connections now use a higher pre-authentication maximum allowed frame limit size by default.
   This means that [larger JWT tokens can be accepted](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/troubleshooting-oauth2) without any configuration.

   GitHub issue: [#13542](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13542)

 * Plugins now can mark queues and streams as protected from deletion by applications.

   GitHub issue: [#13525](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13525)

 * Internal API changes needed by a future version of the [message deduplication plugin](https://github.com/noxdafox/rabbitmq-message-deduplication).

   Contributed by @noxdafox.

   GitHub issue: [#13374](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13374)

#### Bug Fixes

 * Quorum queue leadership transfer could take several seconds longer than necessary to complete.

   GitHub issue: [#13190](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13190)

 * Quorum queue follow replica's last index could lag behind that of the leader.

   GitHub issue: [#13328](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13328)

 * AMQP 0-9-1 channel exception generator could not handle entity names (say, queue or stream names)
   that contained non-ASCII characters.

   This affected applications that use passive queue declarations, such as the Shovel plugin.

   Contributed by @bpint.

   GitHub issue: [#12888](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12888)

 * Reintroduced transient flow control between classic queue replicas and AMQP 0-9-1 channels,
   MQTT connections.

   Flow control between these specific parts of the core were unintentionally
   removed in `4.0.0` together with classic queue mirroring.

   Contributed by @gomoripeti.

   GitHub issue: [#12907](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12907)

 * AMQP 1.0 connections with a higher consumption rate could set the incoming window field
   on the flow frame to a negative value, which resulted in an exception that affected the consumer.

   GitHub issues: [#12816](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12816)

 * In rare cases quorum queue could end up without an elected leader because
   chosen candidate replica was not verified for aliveness.

   Contributed by @Ayanda-D.

   GitHub issues: [#12727](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12727), [#10423](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/discussions/10423), [#12701](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/discussions/12701)

 * When a new replica is added to a quorum queue, the node that handles this request will now wait
   the operation to complete. Previously an early return could result in confusing `cluster_change_not_permitted`
   errors for subsequent operations, for example, an addition of another replica.

   GitHub issue: [#12837](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12837)

 * In a mixed version 4.0/3.13 cluster, dead lettering a message could fail.

   GitHub issue: [#12933](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12933)

 * In very rare cases, RabbitMQ could fail to notify stream consumers connected to follower replicas
   about newly committed offsets as quickly as it usually happens for consumers connected to the stream leader.

   GitHub issue: [#12785](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12785)

### Bug Fixes

 * Default cluster formation timeout with [Khepri](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/metadata-store) now matches that of Mnesia (5 minutes by default).

   Discovered and reported by @evolvedlight.

   GitHub issue: [#13195](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13195)

 * Quorum queues could return a list of members (replicas) with duplicates in some cases.

   GitHub issue: [#13168](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13168)

 * Classic queues with priorities could run into an exception.

   GitHub issue: [#13088](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13088)


### MQTT Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * The default MQTT [Maximum Packet Size](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901086) changed from 256 MiB to 16 MiB.

   This default can be overridden by [configuring](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#config-file) `mqtt.max_packet_size_authenticated`.
   Note that this value must not be greater than `max_message_size` (which also defaults to 16 MiB).


### CLI Tools

#### Breaking Changes and Deprecations

 * `rabbitmqctl force_reset` is **deprecated** as it is incompatible with Khepri,
   which will become the default metadata store in RabbitMQ by 4.2.0.

   GitHub issue: [#13217](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13217)

#### Enhancements

 * New major version of `rabbitmqadmin`, a CLI tool that targets RabbitMQ's HTTP API, has matured.
   Unlike its predecessor, the tool is distirbuted via GitHub as as a standalone native binary.

   There are minor command line interface changes and a slightly different configuration file
   format ([TOML](https://toml.io/en/) instead of `ini`).

   Documentation guide: []().

   GitHub repository: [`rabbitmq/rabbitmqadmin-ng`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmqadmin-ng)

 * New health check for detecting quorum queues without an elected leader.

   ```shell
   # across all virtual host
   rabbitmq-diagnostics check_for_quorum_queues_without_an_elected_leader --across-all-vhosts "^name.pattern.*"
   ```

   ```shell
   # in a specific virtual host
   rabbitmq-diagnostics check_for_quorum_queues_without_an_elected_leader --vhost "vhost-1" "^name.pattern.*"
   ```

   Contributed by @Ayanda-D.

   GitHub issue: [#13487](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13487)

 * `rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_any_deprecated_features_are_used` implementation is now more complete
   (checks for a more deprecated features).

   GitHub issues: [#12619](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12619), [#12675](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12675)

#### Bug Fixes

 * Fixes a false positive that incorrectly reported deprecated feature use, specifically
   the use of non-exclusive transient classic queues.

   GitHub issue: [#12840](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12840)


### Prometheus Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * RabbitMQ nodes now provide a Prometheus histogram for message sizes published by applications.

   This feature allows operators to gain insights into the message sizes being published to RabbitMQ,
   such as average message size, number of messages per pre-defined bucket (which can both be computed accurately), and percentiles (which will be approximated).
   Each metric is labelled by protocol (AMQP 1.0, AMQP 0.9.1, MQTT 5.0, MQTT 3.1.1, and MQTT 3.1).

   GitHub issue: [#12342](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12342)

 * Two new stream metrics for streams.

   Contributed by @gomoripeti and @markus812498.

   GitHub issue: [#12765](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12765)

 * New metric: `queue_identity_info`.

   `queue_identity_info` is a new metric whose labels describe the type
   of the queue and its membership status (leader/follower) on the scraped node.

   GitHub issue: [#13583](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13583)

 * `rabbitmq_identity_info` now includes a new label, `rabbitmq_endpoint`.

   The label allows operators differntiate between metrics scraped from different
   RabbitMQ endpoints (the per-object one and the aggregated one).

   Since some metric names are identical regardless of whether they were
   scraped from `/metrics` and `/metrics/per-object`, scraping both endpoints could lead to
   duplicates and confusion.

   GitHub issue: [#13218](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13218)

### Grafana Dashboards

#### Bug Fixes

 * Grafana 11.3.x compatibility.

   Contributed by @anhanhnguyen.

   GitHub issue: [#12720](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12720)


### Management Plugin

#### Breaking Changes and Deprecations

 * The original HTTP API One True Health Check™ is now a no-op. A comparable "mega health check"
   has long been deprecated in CLI tools and was made a no-op in `4.0.0`.

   This endpoint was using a [deprecated feature](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/deprecated-features): a classic non-exclusive transient (non-durable) queue.

   See [Health Checks](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/monitoring#health-checks) for modern focused alternatives.

   GitHub issue: [#13047](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13047)

#### Enhancements

 * Static assets served by the management UI now have a `control-cache` header set
   to make sure that browsers reload them between upgrades.

   UI code now tries to track version changes to perform a forced reload of the entire page.

   GitHub issue: [#12749](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12749)

 * Connection pages now display detailed AMQP 1.0 session and link information:

   1. Link names
   2. Link target and source addresses
   3. Link flow control state
   4. Session flow control state
   5. Number of unconfirmed and unacknowledged messages
   6. Busy incoming links are now highlighted

   GitHub issues: [#12670](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12670), [#13093](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13093)

 * The management UI now shows if a feature flag has a migration function (in other words, it may take time to be enabled),
   if it is experimental and whether it is supported or not. To enable an experimental feature flag,
   a user must to tick checkboxes to confirm they know what they are doing.

   GitHub issue: [#12643](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12643)

 * Feature flags are now enabled using asynchronous requests in the management UI.
   This means that feature flags that perform data migrations (which can take some time)
   won't block the browser tab.

   GitHub issue: [#12643](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12643)

 * The HTTP API and management UI now can use a [separate chain of authentication and authorization backends](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control).

   This means that a separate list of backends can now be used for the messaging protocol clients and the HTTP API access.

   Contributed by @aaron-seo.

   GitHub issue: [#13465](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13465)

 * The UI now provides a dark theme.

   Contributed by @efimov90.

   GitHub issues: [#13545](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13545), [#3478](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3478)

 * New health check commands help detect quorum queues without an elected leader.

   ```
   # verifies all quorum queues across all virtual hosts
   GET /health/checks/quorum-queues-without-elected-leaders/all-vhosts/
   ```

   ```
   # verifies all quorum queues in the given virtual host
   GET /health/checks/quorum-queues-without-elected-leaders/vhost/{vhost}
   ```

   ```
   # verifies a subset of quorum queue that match the pattern across all virtual hosts
   GET /health/checks/quorum-queues-without-elected-leaders/all-vhosts/pattern/{pattern}
   ```

   ```
   # verifies a subset of quorum queue that match the pattern in the given virtual host
   GET /health/checks/quorum-queues-without-elected-leaders/vhost/{vhost}/pattern/{pattern}
   ```

   Note that the values in the path must be percent-encoded, including the pattern.

   GitHub issue: [#13571](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13571)

 * Web app tab title now changes depending on the selected top-level tab.

   GitHub issue: [#13512](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13512)

#### Bug Fixes

 * Fixes a false positive that incorrectly reported deprecated feature use, specifically
   the use of non-exclusive transient classic queues.

   GitHub issue: [#12840](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12840)

 * Nodes will fail to boot if `rabbit.credit_flow_default_credit` (an `advanced.config`-only, rarely used setting)
   is set to an incompatible pair of values.

   Contributed by @JimmyWang6.

   GitHub issue: [#13046](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13046)

 * When a logged in user's JWT token was refreshed, the user identity displayed in the UI was changed.

   GitHub issue: [#12818](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12818)


### Stream Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Stream replication connections now can be configured to use IPv6 using `advanced.config`:

   ```erl
   [
     {osiris, [
        {replica_ip_address_family, inet6}
     ]}
   ].
   ```

#### Bug Fixes

 * When a connection of one or more consumers in a [Single Active Consumer](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/streams#single-active-consumer) group failed,
   the group could try to activate (promote) one of the consumers are are no longer online. In practical terms
   this means that other consumers were not getting any deliveries.

   GitHub issue: [#13657](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13657)

 * A TCP connection to the stream protocol port that sent no data (e.g. a TCP load balancer check)
   produced a harmless but scary looking exception in the log.

   GitHub issue: [#13701](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13674)


### OAuth 2 AuthN and AuthZ Plugin

#### Breaking Changes and Deprecations

 * The OAuth 2 plugin now requires several values to be explicitly configured by the user
   and will not provide any defaults.

   The affected identity providers are Azure Entra (né Azure AD) and auth0.

   GitHub issue: [#12235](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12235)

### Enhancements

 * Scope aliases now can be configured in `rabbitmq.conf`.

   ```ini
   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.admin = tag:administrator configure:*/*
   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.developer = tag:management configure:*/* read:*/* write:*/*
   ```

   ```ini
   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.1.alias = api://administrator
   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.1.scope = tag:administrator configure:*/*
   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.2.alias = api://developer
   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.2.scope = tag:management configure:*/* read:*/* write:*/*
   ```

   GitHub issue: [#12210](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12210)

 * Support for more complex JWT token structures, such as those sometimes used by Keycloak.

   GitHub issue: [#12324](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12324), [#13216](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13216)

 * [OpenID Discovery Endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationRequest) now can be configured. This is particularly relevant for
   Azure Entra (né Azure AD) users.

   GitHub issue: [#12211](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12211)

### Bug Fixes

 * JWT token refreshes will no longer affect the identity shown in the management UI.

   GitHub issue: [#12598](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12598)


### LDAP Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * The `in_group_nested` query now uses case-insensitive matching, which is more typical of the LDAP tooling.

   GitHub issue: [#13629](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13629)


### Federation Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Exchange federation now can be used with MQTTv5 consumers.

   GitHub issue: [#13115](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13115)

#### Bug Fixes

 * Queue federation could cause a deadlock in a quorum queue replica process.

   GitHub issue: [#12713](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12713)

 * Federation status command and HTTP API endpoint could run into an exception.

   GitHub issue: [#13701](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13701)


### Shovel Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * New Shovel metric: the number of forwarded messages.

   GitHub issue: [#13626](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13626)

#### Bug Fixes

 * AMQP 0-9-1 channel exception generator could not handle entity names (say, queue or stream names)
   that contained non-ASCII characters.

   This affected applications that use passive queue declarations, such as the Shovel plugin.

   GitHub issue: [#12888](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12888)

 * The shutdown sequence of Shovel connections and AMQP 1.0 sessions is now safer.

   GitHub issue: [#2596](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2596)


### Event Exchange Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * The `rabbitmq_event_exchange` plugin now can be configured to internally publish AMQP 1.0 instead of AMQP 0.9.1 messages to the `amq.rabbitmq.event` topic exchange.

   This allows AMQP 1.0 consumers to receive event properties containing complex types such as [lists](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-list)
   or [maps](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-map), for example queue arguments for the `queue.created`
   event or client provided properties for the `connection.created` event.

### AWS Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Avoids an exception during automatic removal of cluster members that are
   no longer returned by peer discovery (an [opt-in feature](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/cluster-formation#node-health-checks-and-cleanup)).

   GitHub issue: [#12809](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12809)


### Kubernetes Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * This plugin was significantly reworked to further reduce the probability of
   two (or more) clusters being formed in a small percentage of cases when
   the entire cluster was started for the first time.

   The plugin no longer relies on the Kubernetes API and instead will try to join
   the first (indexed at `0`) node as the seed node.

   This change is backwards compatible.

   GitHub issue: [#13050](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13050)


#### Bug Fixes

 * Avoids an exception during automatic removal of cluster members that are
   no longer returned by peer discovery (an [opt-in feature](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/cluster-formation#node-health-checks-and-cleanup)).

   GitHub issue: [#12809](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12809)


### Consul Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * `cluster_formation.registration.enabled` is a new configuration setting that allows the backend to skip registration.

   This is useful when Consul is used for peer discovery but a different tool such as Nomad
   is used to keep track of the services and their registration, unregistration.

### Erlang AMQP 1.0 Client

#### Breaking Changes and Deprecations

 * The client now only can declare durable entities in preparation for a Khepri-only
   future version of RabbitMQ.
